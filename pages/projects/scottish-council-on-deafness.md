### Phase 2 April 2015
Improve server arrangement. Purchase and install NAS drive 

we now have a network set up with no internal conflict due to compatibility of software. we have access for remote working offering flexibility for stuff.Remote access would allow SCoD stuff to work outside the office yet have access folders and files.
